     <p>Hi, I'm prithvir and this is my first blog. My hobbies are to play sports and video games. I adore coding and web development. I am a great speller. I speak fluent German though I am still learning.
        I love listening to songs. I study in Wokhardt Global school and I am in 5th Grade. I do not like school, and I don't not love it too. 

    I live in the country India, and the state Maharashtra. I have built a gaming pc at the age of ten, and it is great. Yes, I have many interests,  though i cannot put all of them in just a single 
    paragraph.</p>

    <p>I am currently in the school Wokhardt Global, and I desire to go into the middle school TISB by the age of 14. I <i>was</i> in the school Nath Valley, but my mother was not such a big fan of it. Did I tell you I was a huge fan of sports? But the thing is that i have different phases.
    Recently, I was in the tennis phase, and before that was the cricket phase. Now I am trying to play badminton. I love video games such as Fortnite (tho now its cringe), valorant (nah not so much now), overwatch 2 (It released recently).
    My favorite artist is currently boyWithUke. My brother is a coder too, and web developer. This is his website, <a href="https://gd3.kr" target="_blank">check it out!</a> My other brother has a youtube channel, on which he makes music and does covers of other songs!
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuKFFq385m1q_OQ8HWkLFpQ" target="_blank">His youtube channel!</a></p>

    <p>I had starting coding at the age of 8 years. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Python and JS from codecademy. I often practise the guitar, for which long ago I had done a class.
        I sometimes make banners or posters using canva, but not too often. I am a story writer too, I am currently writing the 2nd part of the Dogos of Eggolympus! (Not yet published). I <i>used</i> to write (type) poems, but did not do such a good job.
        My mom bought me Posca markers recently, and I am drawing stuff with it. I like drawing with markers, not with paints. I like to draw doodles and other things. Youtubers I watch are... Come to think of it i dont watch youtube that much.""
        hello this is a test line.                                                                                           
    </p>
